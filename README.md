# Alpha Vantage Data to Chart

Alpha Vantage (www.alphavantage.co) offers free, historical & realtime data on stocks, physical currencies, and digital/crypto currencies, through their easy to use API. 

Converting this raw data to a chart can be a bit more complicated.  Therefore, this script was created to demonstrate how to use Alpha Vantage's API to retrieve this data, format it and plot it to a chart using matplotlib (in two different varieties). 

Note: To use this script, you need to:

1. Obtain a free API key from Alpha Vantage (https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).

1. Create and save "config.py" in the same directory as "AlphaToChart.py" and add the following line:
`	 api_key ="your API key"`
