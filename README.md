# Alpha Vantage Data to Chart

Alpha Vantage (www.alphavantage.co) offers free, historical & realtime data on stocks, physical currencies, and digital/crypto currencies, through their easy to use API. 

Converting this raw data to a chart can be a bit more complicated.  Therefore, this script was created to demonstrate how to use Alpha Vantage's API to retrieve this data, format it and plot to a chart using matplotlib (in two different varieties).
